 @📝Handling forms nd Images.

 @😶‍🌫️GONNA_FOCUS:->A little fronted is going to introduced in this section,once after finished this then just only focus on "Backend"';

 @💹😗FOCUS: Bootstrap,EJS,Cloudnary
 -creating some form by bear minimum use of "Bootstrap",

 @🔺FIRSTLY:
 Need to FOCUS on "EJS"
 @🧐why?? => you can also inject Bootstrap, plane HTML css & Javascript, then why "EJS":
 =>
 🎗️let's i can also inject those code like Bootstrap and plane HTML & Js here so thin I have to explicitely prepared my Backend here then I've to call fronted via Js,then I've to introdued "Cors",then again I've to introduced fetch request & whole bunch of things.i really want to do that.so for that some of "💹termplete enging" come into picture. that's is 

 -🔺EJS
  Ref:=> 🔗✈️ https://ejs.co/
  -🎗️By, the term termplete mean put HTML kind of code into "Node" environment kind of application.
  -🎗️EJS it use for full fladge web application in the mid case or some of the scalar "node" application Fact: no fronted itself.
  -🎗️Given the fact we'wont be using most of the industrey not preffer this approach this days.
  People preffer: API driven approach is more familier things so, need to be consume on mobile, as well as web so this one we use.
